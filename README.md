# svelte-pathfinder
Testing Svelte responsiveness compared to what I'm used to in React. Learning project, expect not-so-best practices lol.

Barebones remake of the [pathfinding visualizer](https://github.com/TorjeAmundsen/pathfinding-visualizer) I made a year ago in vanilla JS.

# Features:
**Generate a random maze using a recursive division algorithm!**

**Calculate optimal path between start node (red) and end node (purple) using Dijkstra's algorithm!**
